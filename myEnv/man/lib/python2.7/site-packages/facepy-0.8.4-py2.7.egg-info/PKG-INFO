        Facepy makes it really easy to interact with Facebook's Graph API.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            from facepy import GraphAPI
        
            # Initialize the Graph API with a valid access token (optional,
            # but will allow you to do all sorts of fun stuff).
            graph = GraphAPI(oauth_access_token)
        
            # Get my latest posts
            graph.get('me/posts')
        
            # Post a photo of a parrot
            graph.post(
                path = 'me/photos',
                source = open('parrot.jpg')
            )
        
        Facepy can do more than reading your latest posts and posting photographs of parrots, but you'll have to
        `read the documentation <http://readthedocs.org/docs/facepy>`_ to find out how.

        History
        -------
        
        0.8.4
        +++++
        
        * Fixed a bug that caused a KeyError for signed requests that were missing
          some keys for its "page" attribute.
        
        0.8.3
        +++++
        
        * Fixed a bug that caused batch requests with a body to fail.
        * You may now extend access tokens with ``get_extended_access_token``.
        * Fixed a bug that caused paths that started with a slash to fail.
        * Fixed a bug that caused exception messages to be omitted.
        
        0.8.2
        +++++
        
        * Facepy exceptions may now be pickled.
        
        0.8.1
        +++++
        
        * Fixed a bug that caused pagination to stop prematurely.
        
        0.8.0
        +++++
        
        * You may now query application access tokens with ``get_application_access_token``.
        * ``SignedRequest.parse`` now returns a dictionary describing the payload of the signed request
          instead of a ``SignedRequest`` instance.
        * ``SignedRequest.__init__`` now accepts arguments ``signed_request`` and ``application_secret_key`` and no longer
          facilitates for constructing arbitrary signed requests.
        * ``SignedRequest#generate`` no longer requires the provision of ``application_secret_key``.
        * ``SignedRequest#oauth_token`` and ``SignedRequest.OAuthToken`` have been removed (deprecated since v0.6).
        * Fixed a bug that caused some exceptions to be returned rather than raised.
        * ``GraphAPI`` now supports retries for ``get``, ``post``, ``delete``, ``search`` and ``fql``.
        * ``GraphAPI#get`` is now more intelligent about pagination and should no longer query Facebook for another page
          of results if the current page has less elements than ``limit``.
        
        Note: This release is backwards-incompatible.
        
        0.7.0
        +++++
        
        * You may now access the original data of the signed request from ``SignedRequest#raw``.
        * You may now issue FQL queries with ``GraphAPI#fql``.
        * Fixed a bug that caused ``GraphAPI#batch`` to crash upon receiving legacy errors from Facebook.
        * ``FacebookError`` exceptions yielded from ``GraphAPI#batch`` now include the request that
          produced the error.
        
        0.6.9
        +++++
        
        * Facepy will now raise ``OAuthError`` for authorization-related errors.

        +++++
        
        * Fixed a bug that caused some errors to be ignored.

          and ``GraphAPI.FacebookError`` for requests that produced an error in Facebook's API.
        * Fixed a bug that caused an error for empty batch responses.
